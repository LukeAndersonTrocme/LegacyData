  The 1000 Genomes Project aims to provide a deep characterization of human
  genome sequence variation as a foundation for investigating the relationship
  between genotype and phenotype. Here we present results of the pilot phase of
  the project, designed to develop and compare different strategies for
  genome-wide sequencing with high-throughput platforms. We undertook three
  projects: low-coverage whole-genome sequencing of 179 individuals from four
  populations; high-coverage sequencing of two mother-father-child trios; and
  exon-targeted sequencing of 697 individuals from seven populations. We
  describe the location, allele frequency and local haplotype structure of
  approximately 15 million single nucleotide polymorphisms, 1 million short
  insertions and deletions, and 20,000 structural variants, most of which were
  previously undescribed. We show that, because we have catalogued the vast
  majority of common variation, over 95{\%} of the currently accessible
  variants found in any individual are present in this data set. On average,
  each person is found to carry approximately 250 to 300 loss-of-function
  variants in annotated genes and 50 to 100 variants previously implicated in
  inherited disorders. We demonstrate how these results can be used to inform
  association and functional studies. From the two trios, we directly estimate
  the rate of de novo germline base substitution mutations to be approximately
  10(-8) per base pair per generation. We explore the data with regard to
  signatures of natural selection, and identify a marked reduction of genetic
  variation in the neighbourhood of genes, due to selection at linked sites.
  These methods and public data will support the next phase of human genetic
  research.%

  \field{abstract}{%
  By characterizing the geographic and functional spectrum of human genetic
  variation, the 1000 Genomes Project aims to build a resource to help to
  understand the genetic contribution to disease. Here we describe the genomes
  of 1,092 individuals from 14 populations, constructed using a combination of
  low-coverage whole-genome and exome sequencing. By developing methods to
  integrate information across several algorithms and diverse data sources, we
  provide a validated haplotype map of 38|[thinsp]|million single nucleotide
  polymorphisms, 1.4|[thinsp]|million short insertions and deletions, and more
  than 14,000 larger deletions. We show that individuals from different
  populations carry different profiles of rare and common variants, and that
  low-frequency variants show substantial geographic differentiation, which is
  further increased by the action of purifying selection. We show that
  evolutionary conservation and coding consequence are key determinants of the
  strength of purifying selection, that rare-variant load varies substantially
  across biological pathways, and that each individual contains hundreds of
  rare non-coding variants at conserved sites, such as motif-disrupting changes
  in transcription-factor-binding sites. This resource, which captures up to
  98{\%} of accessible single nucleotide polymorphisms at a frequency of 1{\%}
  in related populations, enables analysis of common and low-frequency variants
  in individuals from diverse, including admixed, populations.%

  Our understanding of mutation rate helps us build evolutionary models and
  make sense of genetic variation. Recent work indicates that the frequencies
  of specific mutation types have been elevated in Europe, and that many more,
  subtler signatures of global polymorphism variation may yet remain
  unidentified. Here, we present an analysis of the 1,000 Genomes Project
  (phase 3), suggesting additional putative signatures of mutation rate
  variation across populations and the extent to which they are shaped by local
  sequence context. First, we compiled a list of the most significantly
  variable polymorphism types in a cross-continental statistical test.
  Clustering polymorphisms together, we observed four sets of substitution
  types that showed similar trends of relative mutation rate across
  populations, and describe the patterns of these mutational clusters among
  continental groups. For the majority of these signatures, we found that a
  single flanking base pair of sequence context was sufficient to determine the
  majority of enrichment or depletion of a mutation type. However, local
  genetic context up to 2-3 base pairs away contributes additional variability,
  and helps to interpret a previously noted enrichment of certain polymorphism
  types in some East Asian groups. Building our understanding of mutation rate
  in this way can help us to construct more accurate evolutionary models and
  better understand the mechanisms that underlie genetic change.%

  All cancers are caused by somatic mutations; however, understanding of the
  biological processes generating these mutations is limited. The catalogue of
  somatic mutations from a cancer genome bears the signatures of the mutational
  processes that have been operative. Here we analysed 4,938,362 mutations from
  7,042 cancers and extracted more than 20 distinct mutational signatures. Some
  are present in many cancer types, notably a signature attributed to the
  APOBEC family of cytidine deaminases, whereas others are confined to a single
  cancer class. Certain signatures are associated with age of the patient at
  cancer diagnosis, known mutagenic exposures or defects in DNA maintenance,
  but many are of cryptic origin. In addition to these genome-wide mutational
  signatures, hypermutation localized to small genomic regions, 'kataegis', is
  found in many cancer types. The results reveal the diversity of mutational
  processes underlying the development of cancer, with potential implications
  for understanding of cancer aetiology, prevention and therapy.%

  Ten years ago next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies appeared on the
  market. During the past decade, tremendous progress has been made in terms of
  speed, read length, and throughput, along with a sharp reduction in per-base
  cost. Together, these advances democratized NGS and paved the way for the
  development of a large number of novel NGS applications in basic science as
  well as in translational research areas such as clinical diagnostics,
  agrigenomics, and forensic science. Here we provide an overview of the
  evolution of NGS and discuss the most significant improvements in sequencing
  technologies and library preparation protocols. We also explore the current
  landscape of NGS applications and provide a perspective for future

  As humans dispersed out of Africa they adapted to new environmental
  challenges, including changes in exposure to mutagenic solar radiation.
  Humans in temperate latitudes have acquired light skin that is relatively
  transparent to UV light, and some evidence suggests that their DNA damage
  response pathways have also experienced local adaptation. This raises the
  possibility that different populations have experienced different selective
  pressures affecting genome integrity. Here, I present evidence that the rate
  of a particular mutation type has recently increased in the European
  population, rising in frequency by 50{\%} during the 40,000-80,000 y since
  Europeans began diverging from Asians. A comparison of SNPs private to
  Africa, Asia, and Europe in the 1000 Genomes data reveals that private
  European variation is enriched for the transition 5'-TCC-3' → 5'-TTC-3'.
  Although it is not clear whether UV played a causal role in changing the
  European mutational spectrum, 5'-TCC-3' → 5'-TTC-3' is known to be the most
  common somatic mutation present in melanoma skin cancers, as well as the
  mutation most frequently induced in vitro by UV. Regardless of its causality,
  this change indicates that DNA replication fidelity has not remained stable
  even since the origin of modern humans and might have changed numerous times
  during our recent evolutionary history.%

  {\textless}p{\textgreater}DNA is a remarkably precise medium for copying and
  storing biological information. This high fidelity results from the action of
  hundreds of genes involved in replication, proofreading, and damage repair.
  Evolutionary theory suggests that in such a system, selection has limited
  ability to remove genetic variants that change mutation rates by small
  amounts or in specific sequence contexts. Consistent with this, using SNV
  variation as a proxy for mutational input, we report here that mutational
  spectra differ substantially among species, human continental groups and even
  some closely related populations. Close examination of one signal, an
  increased TCC→TTC mutation rate in Europeans, indicates a burst of
  mutations from about 15,000 to 2000 years ago, perhaps due to the appearance,
  drift, and ultimate elimination of a genetic modifier of mutation rate. Our
  results suggest that mutation rates can evolve markedly over short
  evolutionary timescales and suggest the possibility of mapping mutational
  modifiers.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}%

  Inherited genetic variation has a critical but as yet largely uncharacterized
  role in human disease. Here we report a public database of common variation
  in the human genome: more than one million single nucleotide polymorphisms
  (SNPs) for which accurate and complete genotypes have been obtained in 269
  DNA samples from four populations, including ten 500-kilobase regions in
  which essentially all information about common DNA variation has been
  extracted. These data document the generality of recombination hotspots, a
  block-like structure of linkage disequilibrium and low haplotype diversity,
  leading to substantial correlations of SNPs with many of their neighbours. We
  show how the HapMap resource can guide the design and analysis of genetic
  association studies, shed light on structural variation and recombination,
  and identify loci that may have been subject to natural selection during
  human evolution.%

  Large-scale reference data sets of human genetic variation are critical for
  the medical and functional interpretation of DNA sequence changes. Here we
  describe the aggregation and analysis of high-quality exome (protein-coding
  region) sequence data for 60,706 individuals of diverse ethnicities. The
  resulting catalogue of human genetic diversity has unprecedented resolution,
  with an average of one variant every eight bases of coding sequence and the
  presence of widespread mutational recurrence. The deep catalogue of variation
  provided by the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC) can be used to calculate
  objective metrics of pathogenicity for sequence variants, and to identify
  genes subject to strong selection against various classes of mutation; we
  identify 3,230 genes with near-complete depletion of truncating variants,
  79{\%} of which have no currently established human disease phenotype.
  Finally, we show that these data can be used for the efficient filtering of
  candidate disease-causing variants, and for the discovery of human knockout
  variants in protein-coding genes.%

  Here we report the Simons Genome Diversity Project data set: high quality
  genomes from 300 individuals from 142 diverse populations. These genomes
  include at least 5.8 million base pairs that are not present in the human
  reference genome. Our analysis reveals key features of the landscape of human
  genome variation, including that the rate of accumulation of mutations has
  accelerated by about 5{\%} in non-Africans compared to Africans since
  divergence. We show that the ancestors of some pairs of present-day human
  populations were substantially separated by 100,000 years ago, well before
  the archaeologically attested onset of behavioural modernity. We also
  demonstrate that indigenous Australians, New Guineans and Andamanese do not
  derive substantial ancestry from an early dispersal of modern humans;
  instead, their modern human ancestry is consistent with coming from the same
  source as that of other non-Africans.%

  Mutations occur at vastly different rates across the genome, and populations,
  leading to differences in the spectrum of segregating polymorphisms. Here, we
  investigate variation in the rare variant spectrum in a sample of human
  genomes representing all major world populations. We find at least two
  distinct signatures of variation. One, consistent with a previously reported
  signature is characterized by an increased rate of TCC{\textgreater}TTC
  mutations in people from Western Eurasia and South Asia, likely related to
  differences in the rate, or efficiency of repair, of damage due to
  deamination of methylated guanine. We describe the geographic extent of this
  signature and show that it is detectable in the genomes of ancient, but not
  archaic humans. The second signature is private to certain Native American
  populations, and is concentrated at CpG sites. We show that this signature is
  not driven by differences in the CpG mutation rate, but is a result of the
  fact that highly mutable CpG sites are more likely to undergo multiple
  independent mutations across human populations, and the spectrum of such
  mutations is highly sensitive to recent demography. Both of these effects
  dramatically affect the spectrum of rare variants across human populations,
  and should be taken into account when using mutational clocks to make
  inference about demography. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]%

  \field{abstract}{%
  It is estimated that cigarette smoking kills over 1 000 000 people each year
  by causing lung cancer as well as many other neoplasmas. p53 mutations are
  frequent in tobacco-related cancers and the mutation load is often higher in
  cancers from smokers than from nonsmokers. In lung cancers, the p53
  mutational patterns are different between smokers and nonsmokers with an
  excess of G to T transversions in smoking-associated cancers. The prevalence
  of G to T transversions is 30{\%} in smokers' lung cancer but only 12{\%} in
  lung cancers of nonsmokers. A similar trend exists, albeit less marked, in
  laryngeal cancers and in head and neck cancers. This type of mutation is
  infrequent in most other tumors aside from hepatocellular carcinoma. At
  several p53 mutational hotspots common to all cancers, such as codons 248 and
  273, a large fraction of the mutations are G to T events in lung cancers but
  are almost exclusively G to A transitions in non-tobacco-related cancers. Two
  important classes of tobacco smoke carcinogens are the polycyclic aromatic
  hydrocarbons (PAH) and the nicotine-derived nitrosamines. Recent studies have
  indicated that there is a strong coincidence of G to T transversion hotspots
  in lung cancers and sites of preferential formation of PAH adducts along the
  p53 gene. Endogenously methylated CpG dinucleotides are the preferred sites
  for G to T transversions, accounting for more than 50{\%} of such mutations
  in lung tumors. The same dinucleotide, when present within CpG-methylated
  mutational reporter genes, is the target of G to T transversion hotspots in
  cells exposed to the model PAH compound benzo[a]pyrene-7,8-diol-9,10-epoxide.
  As summarized here, a number of other tobacco smoke carcinogens also can
  cause G to T transversion mutations. The available data suggest that p53
  mutations in lung cancers can be attributed to direct DNA damage from
  cigarette smoke carcinogens rather than to selection of pre-existing
  endogenous mutations.%

  Cancer is driven by mutation. Worldwide, tobacco smoking is the principal
  lifestyle exposure that causes cancer, exerting carcinogenicity through
  {\textgreater}60 chemicals that bind and mutate DNA. Using massively parallel
  sequencing technology, we sequenced a small-cell lung cancer cell line,
  NCI-H209, to explore the mutational burden associated with tobacco smoking. A
  total of 22,910 somatic substitutions were identified, including 134 in
  coding exons. Multiple mutation signatures testify to the cocktail of
  carcinogens in tobacco smoke and their proclivities for particular bases and
  surrounding sequence context. Effects of transcription-coupled repair and a
  second, more general, expression-linked repair pathway were evident. We
  identified a tandem duplication that duplicates exons 3-8 of CHD7 in frame,
  and another two lines carrying PVT1-CHD7 fusion genes, indicating that CHD7
  may be recurrently rearranged in this disease. These findings illustrate the
  potential for next-generation sequencing to provide unprecedented insights
  into mutational processes, cellular repair pathways and gene networks
  associated with cancer.%

  Recent advances in sequencing technologies have enabled the production of
  massive amounts of data on somatic mutations from cancer genomes. These data
  have led to the detection of characteristic patterns of somatic mutations or
  ``mutation signatures{\&}{\#}039;{\&}{\#}039; at an unprecedented resolution,
  with the potential for new insights into the causes and mechanisms of
  tumorigenesis. Here we present new methods for modelling, identifying and
  visualizing such mutation signatures. Our methods greatly simplify mutation
  signature models compared with existing approaches, reducing the number of
  parameters by orders of magnitude even while increasing the contextual
  factors (e.g. the number of flanking bases) that are accounted for. This
  improves both sensitivity and robustness of inferred signatures. We also
  provide a new intuitive way to visualize the signatures, analogous to the use
  of sequence logos to visualize transcription factor binding sites. We
  illustrate our new method on somatic mutation data from urothelial carcinoma
  of the upper urinary tract, and a larger dataset from 30 diverse cancer
  types. The results illustrate several important features of our methods,
  including the ability of our new visualization tool to clearly highlight the
  key features of each signature, the improved robustness of signature
  inferences from small sample sizes, and more detailed inference of signature
  characteristics such as strand biases and sequence context effects at the
  base two positions 5{\&}{\#}039; to the mutated site. The overall framework
  of our work is based on probabilistic models that are closely connected with
  ``mixed-membership models{\&}{\#}039;{\&}{\#}039; which are widely used in
  population genetic admixture analysis, and in machine learning for document
  clustering. We argue that recognizing these relationships should help improve
  understanding of mutation signature extraction problems, and suggests ways to
  further improve the statistical methods. Our methods are implemented in an R
  package pmsignature (https://github.com/friend1ws/pmsignature) and a web
  application available at

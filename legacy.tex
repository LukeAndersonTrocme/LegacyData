\begin{abstract}
Recent reports have identified differences in the mutational spectra across human populations. While some of these reports have been replicated in other cohorts, most have been reported in the 1000 Genomes Project (1kGP) data. While investigating an intriguing putative population stratification within the Japanese population, we identified a previously unreported batch effect leading to spurious mutation calls in the 1kGP data and to the apparent population stratification. Because the 1kGP data is used extensively, we find that the spurious calls also lead to incorrect imputation by leading imputation servers and suspicious GWAS associations. Lower-quality data from the early phases of the 1kGP thus contaminates modern studies in hidden ways, and a community effort may be required to remove or upgrade such legacy sequencing data from reference databases. 
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
	
\subsection{Batch Effects in Aging Reference Cohort Data}			

The last 5 years have seen a drastic increase in the amount and quality of human genome sequence data. 
Reference cohorts such as the International HapMap Project \citep{HapMap2005}, the 1000 Genomes Project (1kGP)\citep{1000GenomesProjectConsortium2010,The1000GenomesProjectConsortium2012}, and the Simons Diversity project \citep{Mallick2016}, for example, have made thousands of genome sequences publicly available for population and medical genetic analyses. 
Many more genomes are available indirectly through servers providing imputation services \citep{HapMap2005} or summary statistics for variant frequency estimation \citep{Lek2016}.

The first genomes in the 1kGP were sequenced 10 years ago \citep{VanDijk2014}. Since then, sequencing platforms have rapidly improved. 
Yet, because of the extraordinary value of freely available data, early data from the 1kGP is still widely used as a reference panel for imputation, allele frequency estimations and to answer a wide range of medical and evolutionary questions. 
The second phase of the 1kGP implemented multiple technological and analytical improvements over its earlier phases \citep{The1000GenomesProjectConsortium2012}, leading to heterogeneous sample preparations and data quality.

Even though such batch effects clearly have the potential to confound analyses, the unrestricted availability of the 1kGP data lead to ubiquitous use making batch effects particularly insidious.   
This raises the question of whether and how such legacy data should be included in contemporary analyses alongside more recent cohorts.
Here we point out how large and previously unreported batch effects in the early phases of the 1kGP still lead to incorrect genetic conclusions through population genetic analyses and spurious GWAS associations as a result of imputation using the 1kGP as a reference.

\subsection{Mutational Signatures}

Different mutagenic processes may preferentially affect different DNA motifs. 
Certain mutagens in tobacco smoke, for example, have been shown to preferentially bind to certain genomic motifs leading to an excess of G to T transversions \citep{Pfeifer2002,Pleasance2010}. 
Thus, exposure of populations to different mutational processes can be inferred by considering the DNA context of polymorphism in search of \textit{signatures} of different mutational processes \citep{Alexandrov2013,Shiraishi2015a}. 
Such genome-wide mutational signatures have been used as diagnostic tools for cancers \citep{Alexandrov2013,Shiraishi2015a}.
%This means that the genomic context of a mutation can be used to gain insight into the cause of this mutation \cite{Pleasance2010}.
%While certain mutagens have very distinct mutational signatures, others are more subtle and difficult to identify because they tend to occur less frequently and with less genomic specificity \cite{Pleasance2010}.
%Large cohorts have recently become available to increase statistical power to resolve some of these fine scale mutational signatures.

In addition to somatic mutational signatures, there has been recent interest in population variation in germline mutational signatures which can be revealed in large sequencing panels. 
In 2015, Harris reported 50\% more TCC ${\rightarrow}$ TTC mutations in European populations compared to African populations, and this was replicated in a different cohort in 2017 \citep{Harris2015a, Harris2017a, Mathieson2017a}. 
Strong population enrichments of a mutational signature suggests important genetic or environmental differences in the history of each population \citep{Harris2015a, Harris2017a}. 
Harris and Pritchard further identified distinct mutational spectra across a range of populations, which were further examined in a recent publication by Aikens et al. \citep{Harris2017a,Aikens2018}.
 
 In particular, both studies  identified a heterogeneous mutational signature within 1000 Genomes Japanese individuals.
This heterogeneity is intriguing because differences in germline signatures accumulate over many generations.
A systematic difference within the Japanese population would suggest sustained environmental or genetic differences across sub-populations within Japan with little to no gene flow.
We therefore decided to follow up on this observation, by using a newly sequenced dataset of Japanese individuals. 

While we were unable to reproduce the mutational heterogeneity within the Japanese population, we could trace back the source of the discrepancy to a technical artefact in the 1kGP data.
In addition to creating biases in mutational signatures, this artefact leads to spurious imputation results which have found their way in recent publications.


The results section is organized as follows.
We first attempt to reproduce the original signal and identify problematic variants in the JPT cohort from the 1kGP. 
Next, we expand our analysis to the other populations in the 1kGP and identify lists of variants that show evidence for technical bias.
Finally, we investigate how these variants have impacted modern genomics analyses.

\section{Results}

			
\subsection{A peculiar mutational signature in Japan}			
	
Harris and Pritchard reported an excess of a 3-mer substitution patterns *AC${\rightarrow}$*CC in a portion of the Japanese individuals in the 1kGP \citep{Harris2017a}.
While trying to follow up on this observation in a larger and more recent Japanese cohort, we did not find this particular signature.
When comparing the allele frequencies between the Japanese individuals from the 1kGP and this larger dataset, we observed a number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) private to one of the two groups.
Given the similarity of the two populations, this strongly suggests a technical difference rather than a population structure effect.
These mismatches were present despite filtering for low-quality regions of the human genome and Hardy-Weinberg disequilibrium. 

When mismatch sites are removed from the 1kGP data, the  *AC${\rightarrow}$*CC signal disappears (Figure \ref{SFS}). To identify possible technical reasons for the difference, we performed regressions of the prevalence of the  *AC${\rightarrow}$*CC mutational signature against different individual-level quality metrics provided by the 1kGP (see Supplementary Figure \ref{PC1_Correlation}). The average quality of mapped bases  $Q$ per individual stood out as a strong correlate : Individuals with low $Q$ show elevated rates of the signature. %(\sgcomment {p value?})
Thus, sequences called from low-$Q$ data contain mutations that reproduce poorly across studies and exhibit a particular mutational signature. 

\begin{figure}

\label{MapQual}
\end{figure}

To identify SNPs that are likely to reproduce poorly across cohorts without having access to a second cohort, we performed an association study in the JPT for SNPs that associate strongly with low $Q$ (Figure \ref{SFS}).
Traditionally, genome wide association studies use genotypes as the independent variable. 
Here we perform a "reverse GWAS", in the sense that genotypes are now the dependent variable that we attempt to predict using the continuous variable $Q$ as the independent variable.
We use logistic regression of the genotypes on $Q$ and identify 587 SNPs with $p < 10^{-8}$ and 1034 SNPs with $ p < 10^{-6}$. 
While identifying putative low-quality SNPs to exclude, using a higher $p$-value threshold increases the stringency of the filtering (i.e., excluding SNPs with $ p < 10^{-6}$ is more stringent than excluding SNPS with $p < 10^{-8}$). 
The variants that are associated to $Q$ have an enrichment in *AC${\rightarrow}$*CC mutations, GA*${\rightarrow}$GG*, and GC*${\rightarrow}$GG* mutations.
These three enrichments can be summarized as an excess of G**${\rightarrow}$GG* in individuals with low $Q$.

Thus, this mutational signal is heavily enriched in suspicious SNPs, but residual signal remains in non-significant SNPs, presumably because many rare alleles found in individuals with low $Q$ remain unidentifiable using association techniques (Figure \ref{MutSpect}).
The removal of individuals with $Q$ below 30 successfully removes the *AC${\rightarrow}$*CC signal, however other signals identified by Harris and Pritchard appear unchanged (Figure \ref{MutSpect}).
For population genetic analyses sensitive to the accumulation of rare variants, the removal of individuals with low $Q$ appears preferable to filtering specific low-quality SNPs. 
For other analyses where quality of imputation matters, identifying suspicious SNPs may be preferable. 
Lists of suspicious SNPs and individuals with low $Q$ are provided as supplementary material \luke{link to file here}.

\subsection{Identifying suspicious variants in the 1kGP}
The distribution of $Q$ across 1kGP populations shows that many populations have distributions of $Q$ scores comparable to that of the JPT, especially populations sequenced in the phase 1 of the project: sequencing done in the early phases of the 1kGP was more variable and overall tended to include lower quality sequencing data (Figure \ref{MapQual}).
This variability could result from evolving sequence platform and protocols or variation between sequencing centres. 
By 2011, older sequencing technologies were phased out, and methods became more consistent, resulting in higher and more uniform quality.


We therefore performed the same reverse GWAS approach in all populations independently, and similarly identified $Q$-associated SNPs in 24 of the 26 populations in the 1kGP, with the phase 1 populations being most affected, with on average four times as many significantly associated sites compared to the phase 3 populations.
Over 3,826 variants were independently associated to low $Q$ in at least two populations with $ p < 10^{-6}$ in each (Figure \ref{OverLap}).

To build a test statistic to represent the association across all populations simultaneously, we performed a simple logistic regression predicting genotype based on $Q$ with population as a covariate to account for population structure.
This method identifies a total of 11,416 statistically significant variants associated to $Q$ (Figures \ref{NRS_Manhattan},\ref{NRI_Manhattan}, \ref{RS_Manhattan}, and \ref{RI_Manhattan}). 
We tested SNPs, INDELs and repetitive regions separately as they may have different error rates (Table \ref{sigTable}).
To account for the large number of tests, we used a two-stage Benjamini \& Hochberg step-up FDR-controlling procedure to adjust the p-values using a nominal Type-I error rate $\alpha = 0.01$ \citep{Benjamini2006}.

  \label{OverLap}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Model selection}
We considered multiple approaches to account for population structure in order to best capture the variants associated to $Q$.
Each of these methods is somewhat similar to the genotype-conditional association test described by Song et al. \citep{song2015testing}.
These methods model each genotype as a logistic function using principal components (PCs), Population membership or both as a covariate. 
We found that these three models to be consistent except a small number of variants with higher associations with the PC model.
We chose the more conservative approach using Population membership as the sole covariate.

\subsection{Cell line or technical artifact}
\luke{Do we keep HapMap? It may be worth keeping some of it to explain why 2/4 papers impute using HapMap and find the same variants.}
To determine whether this signal is the result of a cell line or technical artifact, we investigated other sequencing projects that used the same cell lines.
Conveniently, the HapMap project sequenced some of the same cell lines as in the 1kGP with a different sequencing platform.
The technological artifacts in one platform aren't expected to be present in another sequencing platform as the technological biases vary from platform to platform \citep{Minoche2011}.
If the variants we've identified are the result of a cell line artifact, then we would expect the same variants to be present in the data from two separate platforms.
From the list of 11,416 variants identified as being associated to $Q$, only 17 variants were present in HapMap \citep{HapMap2005}.
Indeed, we find that while there are some variants that are present in HapMap, the number is within the expected number of false discoveries based on our FDR adjustment.
This result suggests that there is no cell line artifact and that the variants identified in the 1kGP are the result of technological artifact.

In 2017, Lan et al. resequenced 83 Han Chinese individuals from the 1kGP \citep{Lan2017}.
After restricting the analysis to individuals in both datasets, we find that 9 out of the 296 the suspicious variants from the single population test are present in the resequenced data \ref{90HanSFS}.
While this is more than 0.1\% of the sites, we suspect that some of these variants may be associated to $Q$ as a result of incorrect genotyping.

We did a similar analysis using the variants identified in the \textit{5PC} model present in the 83 resequenced individuals.
Of the 11,416 suspicious variants identified globally, only 7,607 of them are found in the 83 individuals in the original 1kGP data. (See Figure \ref{90HanSFS_full})
From this subset, only 613 of these variants are present in the resequenced data, the rest are missing entirely.
Figure \ref{90HanSFS_full} shows a weak correlation to allele frequency for the variants present in the resequenced data.
Whereas the vast majority of the SNPs are absent in resequenced data, a high proportion of INDELs are fixed in the resequenced data.
A number of variants shared across cohorts suggests that roughly 10\% of the variants identified are real but genotyped incorrectly.

\subsection{Suspicious variants impact modern genomics analyses}

\subsubsection{Imputation}

The state of the art imputation servers use a combination of many databases including some that are not freely available.
From the perspective of researchers, they act as black-box imputation machines that take observed genotypes as input and return imputed genotypes.  

To investigate the proportion of suspicious variants that are being imputed, we submitted the first two chromosomes of  the 1kGP genotype data to the Michigan Imputation Server.
We found that all of the variants associated with $Q$ were imputed back in the samples.
This suggests that the imputation reference panel still includes individuals with low $Q$, and the dubious variants will be imputed in individuals who most closely match the low-quality individual.

\subsubsection{Microarrays}

We found that 219 of the variants we identified as being associated to $Q$ were present on Illumina's Omni 2.5 chip. This does not mean that these variants are false positives, but rather, that in the 1kGP, individuals with low $Q$ were less likely to be called as having a variant in that position. Moreover, using the 1kGP as a reference panel might impact the population allele frequencies observed for these positions.

\subsubsection{GWAS}

We searched the literature for any GWAS that might have reported these dubious variants as being significantly associated with some biologic al trait, even though there is no particular reason for these variants to be associated with phenotypes.
The NHGRI-EBI Catalog of published genome-wide association studies identified eight recent publications that had reported these variants as close to or above the genome-wide significant threshold (Table \ref{gwasTable}).

One of these studies used the 1kGP in their reference panel for imputation \citep{tian2017genome} and another used the 1kGP sequence data and cell lines directly \citep{Mandage2017}.
Two studies genotyped individuals and imputed the data using the HapMap II as a reference  database for imputation \citep{Kraja2011, Ebejer2013}.

All four papers used strict quality thresholds, including Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium test, deviations in expected allele frequency and sequencing data quality thresholds.
They also removed rare alleles and alleles with high degrees of missingness.
Despite using state-of-the-art quality controls, these erroneous variants managed not only to be imputed onto real genotype data, but they also reached genome wide significance for some biological traits.

\section{Discussion}

\subsection{Technical Artifact}
The variants identified in this study are likely to be technical artifacts from legacy technology.
Different sequencing technologies will have different error profiles. 
A report comparing the Genome Analyzer II (GAII) to the Illumina HiSeq found that the GAII had much higher rates of reads below a quality score of 30 \citep{Minoche2011}, with, for instance, different patterns of quality decrease along reads (known as B-tails). 
Differences in read quality and error profiles in turn require different calling pipelines.
 
We were not able to pinpoint the precise technical source of the discrepancy. 
Further inquiries into the details of sample preparation and data processing would be required to identify the source of this signal. 
For instance, our test was limited by the genome wide resolution of the quality per sample.
Data quality at a SNP-wise resolution would be a better metric to use, but unfortunately was not available.

If the Illumina Genome Analyzer sequencing platforms are no longer being used, then it it likely that these sequencer specific artifacts are no longer being actively introduced in recent sequence data.
However, because the 1kGP data is widely used as a reference database, these variants are still being imputed onto new genotype data and can then impact association studies for a variety of phenotypes.
Our model only reveals association to quality; some variants may be false positives in cases where only individuals with low $Q$ scores have the variant and other variants may be false negatives, in cases where individuals with low $Q$ appear to have lower calling rates for particular.

The imputation of incorrect variants can lead to milder problems such as the addition of noise in polygenic risk scores, biases in fine mapping analyses as well as impact population specific allele frequency estimates.
These variants do have a sizeable effect on population analyses that compare populations based on mutational profiles. 
Even though we expect that present-day technologies will be less sensitive to such artefacts, if is worth pointing out that cancer mutational signature analysis can also be sensitive to technological artefacts that are difficult to detect using classical quality metrics. 

For \textit{conventional} GWAS, we do not see evidence that these contaminated hits impact the conclusions made in each of these publications.
However, considering many polygenic risk score estimates use the association scores from multiple sources, the inclusion of these variants could possibly impact downstream analyses.  

\subsection{Recommendations}
While it may be difficult to determine the exact source of the bias in the data, we have been able to identify individuals and loci that do not meet quality standards expected from high-quality sequencing data.
In order to avoid spurious results, the most conservative approach would be to remove all individuals that do not meet the quality threshold as well as all the variants associated to low $Q$.
We found that a cut-off of $Q = 30$ was sufficient to remove the most egregious spurious signal.
Another approach is to remove all the sites that reach a significance below $ p < 10^{-2}$ in the reverse GWAS (See supplementary material for lists of variants statistically associated to $Q$).
We also recommend the resequencing of samples below an acceptable $Q$ threshold to render them usable.

\section{Conclusion}

On a technical front, we were surprised that strong association between variants and technical covariates in the 1kGP project had not been identified before. 
The genome wide simple logistic regression analysis approach is straightforward, and should probably be a standard in a variety of -omics studies. 

More generally, to improve the quality of genomic reference datasets, we can proceed by addition of new and better data and by better curation of existing data.
Given rapid technological progress, the focus of genomic research is naturally on the data generation side. 
However, cleaning up data is also important to avoid generating spurious results. 
The present findings suggest that a substantial fraction of the final release of the 1kGP project is overdue for removal or re-sequencing.

We have not identified the precise mechanism through which the technical artifact was introduced. Given that modern platforms seem to have resolved this technical issue, but that recent studies continue to be affected by the legacy batch effect, we found it worthwhile to draw attention to the statistical artefact while a sequencing forensics investigation can take place. 


\section{Methods}
\subsection{Metadata}
The metadata used in this analysis was compiled from each of the index files from the 1000 Genomes file system. 
Average quality of mapped bases $Q$ per sample was obtained from the BAS files associated with each alignment file. 
Each BAS file has metadata regarding each sequencing event for each sample. 
If a sample was sequenced more than once, we took the average of the each $Q$ score from each sequencing instance. 
The submission dates and sequencing centres for each sample in the analysis was available in the sequence index files.  
This file also has multiple entries per sample, however, we were unable to match the individual sequencing runs between the bas files and the index file, which lead us to take the average of the $Q$ scores and only kept the earliest sequencing date per sample. 
The dates of the sequencing are only used to plot Figure.

\subsection{Quality Controls}
We reproduced the quality control pipelines used by Harris et. al as they applied the current state of the art quality thresholds to remove questionable sequences especially for the high standards for detecting population level differences. 
Several mask files were applied to remove regions of the genome that might be lower quality, or might have very different mutation rates or base pair complexity compared to the rest of the genome. 
The  1000 Genomes \href{http://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/release/20130502/supporting/accessible_genome_masks/20141020.strict_mask.whole_genome.bed}{strict mask} was used to remove low quality regions of the genome , highly conserved regions were removed using the \href{http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg19/database/phastConsElements100way.txt.gz}{phastCons100way} mask file and highly repetitive regions were also removed using the \href{http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenpath/hg19/database/nestedRepeats.txt.gz}{NestedRepeats} mask file from RepeatMasker. 
Furthermore, only sites with missingness below 0.01, MAF less than 0.1, and MAF greater than 0.9 we're considered.
In total, 57,838,849 diallelic autosomal variants passed our quality controls for the mutation spectrum analysis.

For the reverse GWAS, the only filtration used was the application of an allele frequency cutoff of 0.000599 (removing singletons, doubletons and tripletons) as well as a strict removal of sites with any missing data resulting in a total of 37,700,882 variants ($S$) included in the test (see Table \ref{totTable}). We also used the \href{http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenpath/hg19/database/nestedRepeats.txt.gz}{NestedRepeats} mask file to flag variants inside repetitive regions as these were analyzed separately.

\subsection{Genome wide association study}
We ran a simple logistic regression independently for each genomic locus $s$ using the R glm2 package\citep{RDevelopmentCoreTeam2016}. The model we fitted to each subset of data can be expressed as such.
\begin{align*}
%{logit}{E(Y_{s'i})} &= \beta_{0}  + \beta_{1}{PC1}_{i} + \beta_{2}{PC2}_{i} + \beta_{3}{PC3}_{i} + \beta_{4}{PC4}_{i} + \beta_{5}{PC5}_{i} + \beta_{6}Q_{i}
{logit}{E(Y_{s'i})} &= \beta_{0}  + \beta_{1}{Pop}_{i}  + \beta_{2}Q_{i}
\\
\textit{for}\quad i &= 1,\hdots, n
\end{align*}
Here $Y_{si}$ is a Bernoulli random variable denoting the genotype of individual $i$ at genomic locus $s$. 
%In the model, the regression coefficient $\beta_{1}{PC1}$ represents the coefficient of the first principal component, the slope coefficient $\beta_{6}$ denotes the association to average quality of mapped bases $Q$ to genotype $Y_{s}$. 
In the model, the regression coefficient $\beta_{1}{Pop}_{i}$ represents the coefficient of the categorical variable of Population, the slope coefficient $\beta_{6}$ denotes the association to average quality of mapped bases $Q$ to genotype $Y_{s}$. 
We run a total of $S$ regressions, where $S$ is the total number of genomic loci. 

For each of the $K$ regressions, we formulated a null hypothesis $H_{0}: \beta_{2}^{(s)}=0$. That is, the average quality of mapped bases $Q$ variable is not associated with genotype $Y_{s}$.
In other words, the slope coefficient of the simple logistic regression is zero.
To test the null hypothesis, we used the chi-square likelihood ratio test statistic (the deviance) as a measure of the marginal importance of adding $Q$ in the model. 
The deviance test statistic is approximately chi-square distributed with one degrees of freedom.

Given the large number of tests (of which there are $S$), the large proportion of expected null hypotheses and the positive dependencies across the genome, we used the two-stage Benjamini \& Hochberg step-up FDR-controlling procedure to adjust the \textit{p}-values \citep{Benjamini2006}.
By using a nominal Type-I error rate $\alpha = 0.01$, a total of 11,416 variants were found to be statistically significance. See supplementary file {here}. \luke{make this file}

\subsection{Mutation Spectrum}
We calculated the mutation spectrum of triplets for the list of significant variants for the JPT population using a similar method as described in Harris et al. 2017. \citep{Harris2017a}
We modified the methods as necessary for our purposes, scripts are available \href{https://github.com/LukeAndersonTrocme/QualityPaper}{here}. 

\subsection{Imputation}
Using the Michigan Imputation Server, we imputed the genotype data from 1kGP for chromosomes 1 and 2.
We used the genotyped data from the 1kGP \href{ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/release/20130502/supporting/hd_genotype_chip/ALL.chip.omni_broad_sanger_combined.20140818.snps.genotypes.vcf.gz}{Omni chip} genotype data.
The VCF file returned from the server was then downloaded and used to search for the number of significant variants successfully imputed. 

%\subsection{Frequencies of variants in other datasets}
%Using the allele frequency files for the Japanese HapMap samples, we extracted the positions we identified as being significantly associated to the average quality of mapped bases. We then compared the frequencies of these 70 variants in the 1kGP Japanese samples to those of the HapMap Japanese samples. Figure \ref{HapMap_GnomAD} compares the allele frequencies for suspicious sites that are present in HapMap.

%Similarly, using the allele frequencies from GnomAD, we were able to extract 186 sites that are statistically significantly associated to the average quality of mapped bases. However, in this case we compared global allele frequencies in both the 1kGP and GnomAD (Figure \ref{HapMap_GnomAD}).
